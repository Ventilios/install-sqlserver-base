# Add SQL Server versions directories
* As an example I added a `2019` folder with an example ini and sql file that can be used for deployment.  
* The 2019 (or other version) folder will also need an .iso file related to the version you would like to install. 
For example, for SQL Server 2019 this could be SQLServer2019-x64-ENU-Dev.iso
